### Build Plan
- create list object (COMPLETE)

Will need "complete" boolean, item title, item price, item quantity, category for each list item. Nest inside an overall array to include List title

#### General Data and Layout
- render all list items to the page (COMPLETE)
- build layout to include each piece of data (COMPLETE)
- make existing items editable (COMPLETE)
- create current-cost component (COMPLETE)
- add styling for completed items
- move completed items to end of rendered list (COMPLETE)
- group by category

#### Updating Data
- set up live cost total
- add new item functionality
- add ability to delete item (slide to delete?)
- no context view for already created items; these are updated inline
